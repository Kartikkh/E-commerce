This is basic Setup of Ecommerce Site using JADE as (Templating engine) with instant search feature (using elsatic search)

To use this Kindly follow these steps - 

1  Install all the ###node module (using npm install).

2  Actually I have setup my own MongoDB database so you can setup your own MongoDB database(depends upon your projects).And  don't forget to 
   edit the secret file (which is in Config folder) accordingly.

3  Install elastic search depend upon your OS.

4 And Don't forget to start elastic search before running node server .
